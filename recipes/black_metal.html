		<h1>Black Metal</h1>

		<img src="../images/vv.jpg" height="200" width="200" alt="Scary man holds fluffy companion">

		<p><em>The darkest of all the metals...</em></p>

		<p align="justify" style="max-width:750px;">Black 
		Metal is considered a particularly evil and unrelenting 
		form of metal.  The reasons for this are many, including 
		its divergence from typical modes and song structures 
		(a trait shared with <a href="./death_metal.html">Death 
		Metal</a>), implementation of overly distorted guitars 
		and harsh vocals (a trait shared with <a href="./death_metal.html">
		Death Metal</a>), extreme drumming speeds (a trait shared 
		with <a href="./death_metal.html">Death Metal</a>), and 
		often poor/obscure production quality (a trait 	rarely 
		shared with <a href="./death_metal.html">Death Metal</a>).<br>

		<br>An emphasis on "Satanic" themes is also prevalent
		in the genre; non-Satanic bands in the same style often
		consider themselves <i>Pagan Metal</i> or <i>Viking Metal</i>
		or something similar: these may rely more on traditional
		modes and song structures, but will retain aggression,
		speed, harshness of vocals etc. while possibly adding more
		clean vocals/guitar passages to <em>evoke the ancient or
		medieval.</em>  Traditional Black Metal's invocation of the 
		ancient and medieval is emphatically eerie when it occurs.<br><br>

		In order to kvvk up some Black Metal, there are a few 
		basic things we need:</p>


		<ul>
			<li>A guitar</li>

			<li>An amp (or, if you have no money, a free "Amp Simulator")</li>

			<li>Drums (or a drum machine)</li>

			<li>A DAW (or, for the trve kvlt, a TASCAM 4-track tape recorder from 1986)</li>

			<li>XLR and line cables (min 2 of each)</li>

			<li>A microphone (min 1; max 4 - each mic needs XLR)</li>

			<li>Multi-mic needs sound card/mixer capable of as many tracks 
				(e.g. your 4-track should have 4 XLR inputs)</li>

			<li>TAPES if you are recording to TAPE</li>

		</ul>
	

		<p align="justify" style="max-width:750px;">The steps involved 
		in making Black Metal are reasonably simple (the complexity 
		comes from the depths of emotional turmoil you feel and encode 
		into non-euclidean riffage):</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Make sure all of your gear is plugged in/ready to record:

			<ul>
				<li>Guitar into amp or direct to DAW/TASCAM;</li>

				<li>Amp micced up if necessary; else direct into DAW; else VST ("Simulator")</li>

				<li>Drums micced up or machine into DAW/TASCAM

				<ul>
					<li>It is important to note that a crappier drum 
						sound comes with only using 1 mic</li>

					<li>Using more than one mic is only advised if you 
						want your music to sound halfway decent</li>

				</ul></li>

				<li>Sound card or mixer is plugged into DAW/TASCAM if necessary</li>

			</ul></li>

			<li>Open your DAW/turn on your TASCAM (and make sure your TAPE is installed)</li>

			<li>Arm track(s) for recording</li>

			<li>Hit record (this is often play + record on old tape machines)</li>

			<li>Tell your drummer to hit things (or DIY)/hit your drum machine hard and fast</li>

			<li>Swap to guitar (arm new track[s]), syncopate diminished/whole 
				tone scales with power chords over beat

			<ul>
				<li>Slide chromatically between chords to up the evil</li>

				<li>Occasionally wiggle your fingers up and/or down a fret for 
					no reason</li>

				<li>Always, always tremolo pick; never stop tremolo picking</li>

				<li>Tremolog pick chords - did you read  the last bullet point?</li>

				<li>If you're not tremolo picking, the drummer must have stopped 
					for a bit or something</li>

				<li>The only acceptable reason NOT to be tremolo picking is Celtic 
					Frost pitch bends</li>

				<ul>
					<li>You can still tremolo pick these for added effect</li>

				</ul></li>

			</ul></li>

			<li>Pitch shift an extra guitar track -12 semitones/-1 octave for an awful bass sound!</li>

			<li>Swap your guitar out for a microphone and start SCREAMING PROFANE THINGS

			<ul>
				<li>These can include but are not limited to:

				<ul>
					<li>Satanic Overtones</li>

					<li>Antitheist Implications</li>

					<li>Worship of Forgotten Deities</li>

					<li>Condemnation of Humanity</li>

					<li>Gay ass love for nature</li>

					<li>Winter, cold, snow, frost, ice, hail, sleet, mist... fog... Did I mention Winter?</li>

				</ul>

			</ul>

			<li>Finally, use (resonant) low filters and white noise generators to make your product sound godawful</li>

		</ol>

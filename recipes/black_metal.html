		<p align="center"><em>The darkest of all the metals...</em></p>

		<p align="justify" style="max-width:750px;">Black 
		Metal is considered a particularly evil and unrelenting 
		form of metal.  The reasons for this are many, including 
		its divergence from typical modes and song structures 
		(a trait shared with <a href="./death_metal.html">Death 
		Metal</a>), implementation of overly distorted guitars 
		and harsh vocals (a trait shared with <a href="./death_metal.html">
		Death Metal</a>), extreme drumming speeds (a trait shared 
		with <a href="./death_metal.html">Death Metal</a>), and 
		often poor/obscure production quality (a trait 	rarely 
		shared with <a href="./death_metal.html">Death Metal</a>).<br>

		<br>An emphasis on "Satanic" themes is also prevalent
		in the genre; non-Satanic bands in the same style often
		consider themselves <i>Pagan Metal</i> or <i>Viking Metal</i>
		or something similar: these may rely more on traditional
		modes and song structures, but will retain aggression,
		speed, harshness of vocals etc. while possibly adding more
		clean vocals/guitar passages to <em>evoke the ancient or
		medieval.</em>  Traditional Black Metal's invocation of the <i>
		ancient and medieval</i> is emphatically eerie when it occurs.<br><br>

		<h2>Artefacta Arcanorum</h2>

		<p>In order to kvvk up some Black Metal, there are a few 
		basic things we need:</p>


		<ul>
			<li class="unordered1">A guitar</li>

			<li class="unordered1">An amp (or, if you have no money, a free "Amp Simulator")</li>

			<li class="unordered1">Drums (or a drum machine)</li>

			<li class="unordered1">A DAW (or, for the trve kvlt, a TASCAM 4-track tape recorder from 1986)</li>

			<li class="unordered1">XLR and line cables (min 2 of each)</li>

			<li class="unordered1">A microphone (min 1; max 4 - each mic needs XLR)</li>

			<li class="unordered1">Multi-mic needs sound card/mixer capable of as many tracks 
				(e.g. your 4-track should have 4 XLR inputs)</li>

			<li class="unordered1">TAPES if you are recording to TAPE</li>

		</ul>
	
		<h2>Conjuring Cacophony</h2>

		<p align="justify" style="max-width:750px;">The steps involved 
		in making Black Metal are reasonably simple (the complexity 
		comes from the depths of emotional turmoil you feel and subsequently 
		encode into non-euclidean riffage):</p>

		<ol class="orderedlist">
			<li class="ordered">Make sure all of your gear is plugged in/ready to record:

			<ul>
				<li class="unordered2">Guitar into amp or direct to computer if using software amp;</li>

				<li class="unordered2">Amp micced up if necessary; else direct into DAW via line cable</li>

				<li class="unordered2">Drums micced up or machine into DAW/TASCAM

				<ul>
					<li class="unordered3"><i>It is important to note that a crappier drum 
						sound comes with only using 1 mic</i></li>

					<li class="unordered3"><em>Using more than one mic is only advised if you 
						want your music to sound <strong>halfway decent</strong></em></li>

				</ul></li>

				<li class="unordered2">Sound card/mixer is plugged into DAW/TASCAM if necessary</li>

			</ul></li>

			<li class="ordered">Open your DAW/turn on your TASCAM (and make sure your TAPE is installed)</li>

			<li class="ordered">Arm track(s) for recording</li>

			<li class="ordered">Hit record (this is often play + record on old tape machines)</li>

			<li class="ordered">Tell your drummer to hit things (or DIY)/hit your drum machine hard and fast</li>

			<li class="ordered">Swap to guitar (arm new track[s]), syncopate diminished/whole 
				tone scales with power chords over beat

			<ul>
				<li class="unordered2">Slide chromatically between chords to up the evil</li>

				<li class="unordered2">Occasionally wiggle your fingers up and/or down a fret for 
					no reason</li>

				<li class="unordered2">Always, always tremolo pick; never stop tremolo picking</li>

				<li class="unordered2">Tremolog pick chords - did you read  the last bullet point?</li>

				<li class="unordered2">If you're not tremolo picking, the drummer must have stopped 
					for a bit or something</li>

				<li class="unordered2">The only acceptable reason NOT to be tremolo picking is Celtic 
					Frost pitch bends</li>

				<ul>
					<li class="unordered3">You can still tremolo pick these for added effect</li>

				</ul></li>

			</ul></li>

			<li class="ordered">Pitch shift an extra guitar track -12 semitones/-1 octave for an awful bass sound!</li>

			<li class="ordered">Swap your guitar out for a microphone and start SCREAMING PROFANE THINGS

			<ul>
				<li class="unordered2">These can include but are not limited to:

				<ul>
					<li class="unordered3">Satanic Overtones</li>

					<li class="unordered3">Antitheist Implications</li>

					<li class="unordered3">Worship of Forgotten Deities</li>

					<li class="unordered3">Condemnation of Humanity</li>

					<li class="unordered3">Wistful love for nature</li>

					<li class="unordered3">Winter, cold, snow, frost, ice, hail, sleet, mist... fog... Did I mention Winter?</li>

				</ul>

			</ul>

			<li class="ordered">Finally, use (resonant) low filters and white noise generators to make your product sound godawful</li>
